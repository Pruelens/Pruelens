### About me

</div>
Hey there! I'm Philip Ruelens, an evolutionary biologist who is fascinated by the many factors that impact the **tempo and mode** of evolution. Put simply, I'm interested in what makes certain evolutionary paths possible, what are the actual paths that evolution is able to take and —if there is a discrepancy between the two— what are the factors affecting their difference. To do this, I use a combination of experimental, phylogenetic and modelling approaches. As I am interested in the universal drivers of evolution, I prefer to work on a wide range of different organisms and mechanisms.
