Hey there ðŸ‘‹! I'm [Philip Ruelens](https://pruelens.github.io), and I'm an evolutionary biologist with a passion for understanding the intricate factors that shape the tempo and mode of evolution. My research focuses on identifying the underlying mechanisms that influence evolutionary trajectories, and examining the factors that contribute to discrepancies between the potential and actual paths that evolution can take. To tackle these questions, I employ a combination of experimental, phylogenetic and modelling approaches. As a scientist interested in uncovering the fundamental drivers of evolution, I work with a wide range of different organisms and mechanisms to gain a holistic understanding of the processes at play.

Why should you care about evolutionary research? Well, as human activities continue to alter natural habitats, climate, and the distribution of resources, the selective pressures acting on organisms are changing rapidly. This can lead to rapid adaptation or extinction of species that cannot cope with these changes. By studying the mechanisms underlying evolution and adaptation in response to environmental changes, we can better predict how species will respond to novel selective pressures, which may inform ecosystem management strategies, such as habitat restoration, bioremediation, or soil management. Additionally, understanding the evolution of pathogens can help us anticipate and prevent the emergence of new infectious diseases and variants, protecting both human and animal health.
